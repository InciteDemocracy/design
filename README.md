* *Early thoughts and brainstorming:* Google docs saved to RC Drive / Design folder
* *Wireframes and prototypes:* Depending on fidelity and purpose, the main goal is making sure itâ€™s shareable with folks if we're not around
* *Hi-fi mocks and final assets:* upload to github in consistent file structure
